Hello Dani,

- Library -> few lines added/changed (10 or so)

- new dust added (temp)

- app.js last 400lines or so (don’t ask), possibly also one line at the very top

- css changed, need to make same for follow-playlists

- check and update User/FollowPlaylist schemas, not sure whats in your current version

That should be most of it, maybe some few lines in other places can’t remember can’t think can’t write.

ok a domani
