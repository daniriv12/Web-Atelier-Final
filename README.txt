Please put here your most advanced working projects to be merged. 
A readme.txt file indicating file changes would be appreciated but will make due without.
Use different folder names to avoid overwriting.

I will first attempt using the git merging.. but we know how well that works.

  issues fixed:
    - now player works also for playlist (no duplicated items!!)
